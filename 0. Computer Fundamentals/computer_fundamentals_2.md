In the previous article, we explored the fascinating history of computers and their defining characteristics. Now, let's delve into computer Operating Systems as well as file systems.

[The File System](#the-file-system)

# OPERATING SYSTEM

Why many flavors. why mac windows linux. whats different. why have OS

hw > OS > Apps > programmer

OS > file system, network, memory, process, multiprocess

# School Analogy

what is file (review), what is direcotyr, why need to change it. what is the current working directory, ...

single-level directory
two-level directory => need to navigate

Analogy: can have one big notebook, with history math and physics and chemistry notes. However, we all know that it's much easier to sort through things by having a separate notebook for each subject.
Now what if in history class, you have your notebook with your class notes, but one day the teacher asks you to take out a single piece of paper for the weekly quiz. Now you have a notebook, and a single piece of paper. after 8 weeks, you would have 8 single pieces of paper, which should logically be physically together. You don't want history quiz 1 to be between the math and physics notebooks. That'd be a mess when it's time to find the quiz and review it. --> Folder ...
go back to the profile picture example. or the game graphics. behind all of these visuals, is computer code. and code is just text that get's converted to machine code that the computer can understand.  
For the profile picture, that picture is stored somewhere on facebook's server, and when someone visits your account, the page just has a pointer to the location on the server where your picture resides. its a file. everything is stored in files. A typical program executes sequentially, one command at a time. so technically can have one big chunck of code. but that's just like having one large notebook containing all your class notes from all your courses. and computers have way more information than a year's worth of class notes. computers are very complex today, and it's better to organize and store the different funcitonalities into separate files, just like it's better to put different course material in different folders.
