# A Brief History of Computing

## The Jacaquard Loom: Breakthrough in Automation

Before the year 1805, if I wanted to make a piece of cloth, such as a napkin, with a beautiful design on it, I would have to use a device called a handloom and manually control the position of each thread to create the desired pattern. And if I wanted to make two such napkins, I'd have to redo the entire process.

However, then came the Jacquard loom, named after the French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard. This device used a system of stiff paper with holes punched into them in specific patterns, which was a representation of a portion of the actual design pattern. So now, instead of manually controlling the threads with my hands, I would insert a series of these punch cards into the loom, and the machine would lift and lower threads based on the hole positions on the card. Watch [this short animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NgMNvK52A) demonstrating this process.

What does this have to do with computers? Well, while the Jacquard loom is not directly related to the development of computers, it started a conversation about input and output, as well as automation and "feeding instructions" to a machine. 

"Input" is what goes "in" a system, and "output" is what comes "out" as a result. Before the Jacquard loom, direct human intervention was critical in the input to get the desired output. In the case of the Jacquard loom, at a given moment, the input is a punch card, and the output is a row of threads being woven in a specific pattern, all without the "human touch".

This invention laid the foundation for key concepts in computing, notably the idea of feeding punch cards (containing instructions) as input to a machine. It foreshadowed the later development of computing devices.

## Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine: Conceptualizing the Computer

The first device considered a computer was the Analytical Engine, conceptualized by English inventor Charles Babbage in the 1830s. Although it was never fully constructed during his lifetime, Babbage's designs and ideas laid the foundation for modern computing.

What made this device the first computer? Well, because it had all functionalities of one: there was a reader to accept inputs in the form of punch cards, a printer to output and print the results, a processing unit to perform computations, and a storage unit to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. The Analytical Engine was an early, mechanical version of a general-purpose computer capable of solving various math problems using a steam engine to power the machine and turn all its gears.

## : The First Modern Computer

It wasn't until a hundred years after Babbage conceptualized his Analytical Engine that the first physical computer was actually built. We are now in the early 1940s, in the middle of the Second World War, and electricity has played a major role in the development of many new technologies, replacing their mechanical counteparts.

One such technology is vacuum tubes, electronic devices that controlled and amplified electrical signals, providing the means to process and control data electronically. These glass or metal containers, filled with a vacuum or low-pressure gas, acted as switches and amplifiers in early electronic computers, enabling the manipulation of electrical currents and the implementation of logical operations.

During this time, several pioneering computers were independently designed, representing significant advancements in the field of electronic computing. These included the Z3 created by Konrad Zuse in Germany, the Colossus developed in the United Kingdom for code-breaking purposes, and the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) designed by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry in the United States.

## Computer Terminals: An Advancement in Human-Computer Interaction

Vacuum tubes were not without their challenges. They were fragile, consumed a significant amount of power, generated heat, and had a limited lifespan. The need to replace faulty tubes and the sheer number of tubes required in early computers made them bulky, expensive, and prone to frequent failures. hese shortcomings drove the need for a more compact and robust electronic component that could replace vacuum tubes in computing systems.

In 1947, the invention of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs revolutionized the field of electronics. Transistors are solid-state devices made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon or germanium, and they function as switches or amplifiers for electronic signals.

Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors offered several advantages. They were much smaller in size, consumed less power, generated less heat, and were more reliable and durable. Transistors also switched on and off faster than vacuum tubes, allowing for higher-speed computing operations.

The advent of transistors led to the development of the second generation of computers, known as transistorized computers. These computers were smaller, faster, and more efficient than their vacuum tube predecessors. They marked a significant shift in the design and construction of computers, making them more practical for various applications.

Transistors allowed for the miniaturization of electronic components, paving the way for the development of integrated circuits (ICs) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. ICs combined multiple transistors, resistors, and capacitors onto a single silicon chip, enabling even greater reductions in size and power consumption.

1. start off with jacquard loom. 
These cards were pieces of stiff paper that had holes punched in them in specific patterns to represent data or instructions.
2. then mention the first compouter designed (but never built): charles babbages' analytical engine. What made it a computer? what was different?
3. Then talk about how electrcity started to be used widely and in many industries, including replacing punch cards and the mechanical counterparts. 
4. first computer ENIAC. why was it considered a computer, and not everything that came before it. Can you imagine how they'd have to deal with component failures on this machine? It's bad enough with the vacuum tubes in things like ENIAC, which would all have to be shut down and left to cool before someone had to crawl in and find the blown tube, but that would be a relatively simple proposition compared with hunting down a gear or ratchet or spring which had failed, and they would fail at an alarming rate, given the complexity of the machine and the sheer friction generated in use. The room in which this would have been housed would have been incredibly noisy and hot.
5. talk about terminals. what were they, why is the screen black . computer terminals were physical devices used to interact with mainframe computers. why were they black backgrounds?

6. what did NASA use to do their missions (early on)?

# The Modern State of Computers

transistors now instead 

Continue from the history. talk how today, we have applications such as photoshop. we watch videos, save and look at pictures. We play videogames with high quality graphics. if it wasn't for the visual aspect, computers wouldn't be so mainstream. we have a profile picture on our social media accounts, which are all mainly based on pictures and videos. That's why GUI is important

but today not only have gui, but when want to access a server, there is only cli. when dealing with cloud computing. when anything is still new, and you are working with new/"not widely-used" tech, then cli will be the way to go. and programmers are always working with new tech, that's what the best companies do, is explore and expand their business into new tech

# Computer Fundamentals

Watching cat videos on a computer is cool, but what is a computer fundamentally? What makes a given device a "computer"? Because clearly, if our laptops didn't give us access to cat videos, it would still be considered a computer... right?

Well, the word "computer" comes from the verb "to compute", and by adding "er" to the end it means "someone that computes", just like what "writer" is to "write", "dancer" is to "dance", and "programmer" is to "program".

Since the first use of the word in the 1600's, "computers" have evolved. They have gone from a person who computes, to machines that compute. But is computing all that is really required nowadays to be considered a "computer"? For example, take [a "computer" made up of dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6E7aQnA4Ws). Woudl this system technically be a computer? Definitely not (even though in the video, they call it a computer, but they're using the simpler definition of a computer as "something that computes").

Why isn't a ["domino computer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w) or a ["water computer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw) technically a computer? Because in order to be a computer, you have to do more than just perform mathematical computations. That's why a basic calculator isn't a computer.

For one, these systems don't have a way to store data or retrieve previous calculations. 


1. why wasn't the jacquard loom considered a computer? what made the babbage analytical engine be a "computer"?
2. what about a hypothetical device that just takes in sound, and outputs sound. would that be labeled as a computer? why or why not?
3. what are the basic requirements for a device to be considered a computer? what is the bare minimum. what is the simplest computer a person can make?
4. analyze situation of embedded device in fridge. 
5. talk about the computational complexity spectrum, what are the extremes (maybe). talk about software and hardware, talk how can connect external devices using drivers. can get complicated. 
important: make sure to explain what is a computer and what it is not. don't just give boring definitions.

6. mention a sentence or two on: we can simulate a computer using a computer

Domino computer example. 

Now the question is "Can a domino computer become self-aware and destroy humanity?". 


Add some tips,fun facts, notes and questions along the way
> Name a computer around you that usually people don't see as a computer. 

Mention about the modern OS:
Now talk about how to organize everything, drivers, etc. you want a special software that will manage all of those things that we don't need the user to manage. 


The I/O could be anything. But as it turned out
From punch cards, we moved on to keyboards, mice, and monitors as primary I/O devices when personal computers began to be common in the late 20th century. Keyboards and mice provide input, allowing us to tell the computer what to do, while monitors provide output, letting us see what the computer is doing or has done.

# The File System 
Analogy: can have one big notebook, with history math and physics and chemistry notes. However, we all know that it's much easier to sort through things by having a separate notebook for each subject.
Now what if in history class, you have your notebook with your class notes, but one day the teacher asks you to take out a single piece of paper for the weekly quiz. Now you have a notebook, and a single piece of paper. after 8 weeks, you would have 8 single pieces of paper, which should logically be physically together. You don't want history quiz 1 to be between the math and physics notebooks. That'd be a mess when it's time to find the quiz and review it. --> Folder ...
go back to the profile picture example. or the game graphics. behind all of these visuals, is computer code. and code is just text that get's converted to machine code that the computer can understand.  
For the profile picture, that picture is stored somewhere on facebook's server, and when someone visits your account, the page just has a pointer to the location on the server where your picture resides. its a file. everything is stored in files. A typical program executes sequentially, one command at a time. so technically can have one big chunck of code. but that's just like having one large notebook containing all your class notes from all your courses. and computers have way more information than a year's worth of class notes. computers are very complex today, and it's better to organize and store the different funcitonalities into separate files, just like it's better to put different course material in different folders.
