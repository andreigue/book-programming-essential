# Overview:

[A Brief History of Computing](#a-brief-history-of-computing) 
talk all the way up to early computers that used terminals for i/o. computer terminals were physical devices used to interact with mainframe computers. why were they black backgrounds?

1. start off with jacquard loom. 
2. then mention the first compouter designed (but never built): charles babbages' analytical engine. 
3. Then talk about how electrcity started to be used widely and in many industries, including replacing punch cards and the mechanical counterparts. 
4. first computer ENIAC
5. talk about terminals. what were they, why is the screen black
6. what did NASA use to do their missions (early on)?

[Introduction to Modern Computers](#introduction-to-computers) 
Continue from the history. talk how today, we have applications such as photoshop. we watch videos, save and look at pictures. We play videogames with high quality graphics. if it wasn't for the visual aspect, computers wouldn't be so mainstream. we have a profile picture on our social media accounts, which are all mainly based on pictures and videos. That's why GUI is important

but today not only have gui, but when want to access a server, there is only cli. when dealing with cloud computing. when anything is still new, and you are working with new/"not widely-used" tech, then cli will be the way to go. and programmers are always working with new tech, that's what the best companies do, is explore and expand their business into new tech

[What is a Computer?](#what-is-a-computer)
1. why wasn't the jacquard loom considered a computer? what made the babbage analytical engine be a "computer"?
2. what about a hypothetical device that just takes in sound, and outputs sound. would that be labeled as a computer? why or why not?
3. what are the basic requirements for a device to be considered a computer? what is the bare minimum. what is the simplest computer a person can make?
4. analyze situation of embedded device in fridge. 
5. talk about the computational complexity spectrum, what are the extremes (maybe). talk about software and hardware, talk how can connect external devices using drivers. can get complicated. 
important: make sure to explain what is a computer and what it is not. don't just give boring definitions.

6. mention a sentence or two on: we can simulate a computer using a computer

Add some tips,fun facts, notes and questions along the way
> Name a computer around you that usually people don't see as a computer. 

Mention about the modern OS:
Now talk about how to organize everything, drivers, etc. you want a special software that will manage all of those things that we don't need the user to manage. 

[The File System](#the-file-system) 
Analogy: can have one big notebook, with history math and physics and chemistry notes. However, we all know that it's much easier to sort through things by having a separate notebook for each subject.
Now what if in history class, you have your notebook with your class notes, but one day the teacher asks you to take out a single piece of paper for the weekly quiz. Now you have a notebook, and a single piece of paper. after 8 weeks, you would have 8 single pieces of paper, which should logically be physically together. You don't want history quiz 1 to be between the math and physics notebooks. That'd be a mess when it's time to find the quiz and review it. --> Folder ...
go back to the profile picture example. or the game graphics. behind all of these visuals, is computer code. and code is just text that get's converted to machine code that the computer can understand.  
For the profile picture, that picture is stored somewhere on facebook's server, and when someone visits your account, the page just has a pointer to the location on the server where your picture resides. its a file. everything is stored in files. A typical program executes sequentially, one command at a time. so technically can have one big chunck of code. but that's just like having one large notebook containing all your class notes from all your courses. and computers have way more information than a year's worth of class notes. computers are very complex today, and it's better to organize and store the different funcitonalities into separate files, just like it's better to put different course material in different folders.
