[A Brief History of Computing](#a-brief-history-of-computing) 
talk all the way up to early computers that used terminals for i/o. computer terminals were physical devices used to interact with mainframe computers. why were they black backgrounds?

[Introduction to Modern Computers](#introduction-to-computers) 
Continue from the history. talk how today, we have applications such as photoshop. we watch videos, save and look at pictures. We play videogames with high quality graphics. if it wasn't for the visual aspect, computers wouldn't be so mainstream. we have a profile picture on our social media accounts, which are all mainly based on pictures and videos. That's why GUI is important

[What is a Computer?](#what-is-a-computer) 
At its core, what is a computer. talk about embedded device in fridge. talk about the computational complexity spectrum, what are the extremes (maybe). talk about software and hardware, talk how can connect external devices using drivers. can get complicated.

how user interacts with computer. evolution of it. device maybe just takes in sound, and interact that way. don't just tell the reader some definitions. explain what is a computer and what is it not. what is a computers basic structure. what is the bare minimum for something to be considered a computer? was the loom considered a computer? what makes a machine a computer? io cpu,etc

we can simulate a computer using a computer. one or two sentence on that

Add some tips,fun facts, notes and questions along the way
> Name a computer around you that usually people don't see as a computer. 

Mention about the modern OS:
Now talk about how to organize everything, drivers, etc. you want a special software that will manage all of those things that we don't need the user to manage. 

[The File System](#the-file-system) 
Analogy: can have one big notebook, with history math and physics and chemistry notes. However, we all know that it's much easier to sort through things by having a separate notebook for each subject.
Now what if in history class, you have your notebook with your class notes, but one day the teacher asks you to take out a single piece of paper for the weekly quiz. Now you have a notebook, and a single piece of paper. after 8 weeks, you would have 8 single pieces of paper, which should logically be physically together. You don't want history quiz 1 to be between the math and physics notebooks. That'd be a mess when it's time to find the quiz and review it. --> Folder ...
go back to the profile picture example. or the game graphics. behind all of these visuals, is computer code. and code is just text that get's converted to machine code that the computer can understand.  
For the profile picture, that picture is stored somewhere on facebook's server, and when someone visits your account, the page just has a pointer to the location on the server where your picture resides. its a file. everything is stored in files. A typical program executes sequentially, one command at a time. so technically can have one big chunck of code. but that's just like having one large notebook containing all your class notes from all your courses. and computers have way more information than a year's worth of class notes. computers are very complex today, and it's better to organize and store the different funcitonalities into separate files, just like it's better to put different course material in different folders.
