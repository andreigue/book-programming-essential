# A Brief History of Computing

## The Jacaquard Loom: Breakthrough in Automation

Before the year 1805, if I wanted to make a piece of cloth, such as a napkin, with a beautiful design on it, I would have to use a device called a handloom and manually control the position of each thread to create the desired pattern. And if I wanted to make two such napkins, I'd have to redo the entire process, and they would unlikely be exactly the same.

However, then came the Jacquard loom, named after the French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard. This device used a system of stiff paper with holes punched into them in specific patterns, which was a representation of a portion of the actual design pattern. So now, instead of manually controlling the threads with my hands, I would insert a series of these punch cards into the loom, and the machine would would lift and lower threads based on the hole positions on the card. Watch [this short animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NgMNvK52A) demonstrating this process.

You may be wondering "this is great and all, but what does this have to do with computers"? While the Jacquard loom is not directly related to the development of computers, it started the conversation of I/O, or "input and output", as well as automation and feeding a device "instructions". "Input" is what goes "in" a system, and "output" is what comes "out" as a result. Before the Jacquard loom, direct human intervention was critical in the input to get the desired output. In the case of the Jacquard loom, at a given moment, the input is a punch card, and the output is a row of threads being woven in a specific pattern, all without the human "touch". 

We could indirectly feed the machine instructions, and it will what we wanted it to do.

## Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine: Conceptualizing the Computer

The first device considered a computer was the Analytical Engine, conceptualized by English mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage in the 1830's. Although it was never fully constructed during his lifetime, Babbage's designs and ideas laid the foundation for modern computing.

Now, what made the Analytical Engine a computer? 

...

The Analytical Engine was designed as a mechanical, general-purpose computing machine. It featured several key components, including a central processing unit, memory, punch cards for input and output, and an arithmetic unit. Babbage envisioned a machine that could perform calculations, store and manipulate data, and execute complex programs using punch cards for instructions.

While the Analytical Engine was never completed, Babbage's designs and concepts were ahead of their time and paved the way for subsequent developments in computing. His work laid the groundwork for the modern concept of a programmable computer, influencing future inventors and engineers in the field of computing.

## Tabulating Machines: A Revolution in Information Management

Rememebr those punch cards that were used as input for the Jacquard loom? Well those punch cards ...


Rather than just being a physical obstruction to a needle moving, it turns out that we can represent data with 


These cards were pieces of stiff paper that had holes punched in them in specific patterns to represent data or instructions. When we write the letters 'a', 'n', and 'd' on a piece of paper, these are just drawing of characters that represent information


Herman Hollerith, an American inventor, developed and popularized the use of punched cards for data processing in the late 19th century. He utilized punch cards as a means of encoding information in a binary-like format for efficient tabulation and analysis. Hollerith's system allowed data to be encoded on punched cards with specific hole positions representing different data values or categories.

Hollerith's punched card system gained widespread recognition and adoption, particularly during the 1890 United States Census. His system enabled the census data to be processed more quickly and accurately compared to traditional manual methods. Hollerith's innovations and the success of his punched card technology led to the founding of the Tabulating Machine Company, which eventually evolved into IBM (International Business Machines) Corporation.

Therefore, it was Herman Hollerith who harnessed the potential of punch cards to represent and process data, paving the way for their extensive use in early data processing and setting the stage for further advancements in computing technology.

## The ENIAC: The First Modern Computer

In the early 1900's, the use of electricity was becoming more and more widespread. By the second world war, electrical components were starting to replace mechanical ones, and ...

The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), completed in 1945, was the first general-purpose electronic computer.

The ENIAC was an enormous machine, occupying a large room and comprising thousands of vacuum tubes, resistors, capacitors, and other electronic components. It was primarily developed for military purposes, assisting in complex calculations for artillery trajectory tables during World War II.

While the ENIAC was groundbreaking in terms of its capabilities, it had its limitations. It required a significant amount of power to operate, generated a considerable amount of heat, and required manual rewiring for each new computation. Nevertheless, the ENIAC laid the foundation for future electronic computers and demonstrated the vast potential of electronic technology in computing.

The use of vacuum tubes allowed for the creation of electronic circuits that could perform logic operations and amplify electrical signals. They became a fundamental building block of early electronic computers, such as the ENIAC, providing the means to process and control data electronically.

Vacuum tubes were not without their challenges. They were fragile, consumed a significant amount of power, generated heat, and had a limited lifespan. The need to replace faulty tubes and the sheer number of tubes required in early computers made them bulky, expensive, and prone to frequent failures. However, vacuum tubes represented a crucial advancement in electronic technology, marking the transition from mechanical to electrical components and paving the way for further developments in computing.


## Computer Terminals: An Advancement in Human-Computer Interaction

Vacuum tubes, despite their contributions to early electronic computers, had limitations such as being bulky, power-hungry, and prone to failure. These shortcomings drove the need for a more compact and robust electronic component that could replace vacuum tubes in computing systems.

In 1947, the invention of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs revolutionized the field of electronics. Transistors are solid-state devices made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon or germanium, and they function as switches or amplifiers for electronic signals.

Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors offered several advantages. They were much smaller in size, consumed less power, generated less heat, and were more reliable and durable. Transistors also switched on and off faster than vacuum tubes, allowing for higher-speed computing operations.

The advent of transistors led to the development of the second generation of computers, known as transistorized computers. These computers were smaller, faster, and more efficient than their vacuum tube predecessors. They marked a significant shift in the design and construction of computers, making them more practical for various applications.

Transistors allowed for the miniaturization of electronic components, paving the way for the development of integrated circuits (ICs) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. ICs combined multiple transistors, resistors, and capacitors onto a single silicon chip, enabling even greater reductions in size and power consumption.

1. start off with jacquard loom. 
These cards were pieces of stiff paper that had holes punched in them in specific patterns to represent data or instructions.
2. then mention the first compouter designed (but never built): charles babbages' analytical engine. What made it a computer? what was different?
3. Then talk about how electrcity started to be used widely and in many industries, including replacing punch cards and the mechanical counterparts. 
4. first computer ENIAC. why was it considered a computer, and not everything that came before it. Can you imagine how they'd have to deal with component failures on this machine? It's bad enough with the vacuum tubes in things like ENIAC, which would all have to be shut down and left to cool before someone had to crawl in and find the blown tube, but that would be a relatively simple proposition compared with hunting down a gear or ratchet or spring which had failed, and they would fail at an alarming rate, given the complexity of the machine and the sheer friction generated in use. The room in which this would have been housed would have been incredibly noisy and hot.
5. talk about terminals. what were they, why is the screen black . computer terminals were physical devices used to interact with mainframe computers. why were they black backgrounds?

6. what did NASA use to do their missions (early on)?

# The Modern State of Computers

transistors now instead 

Continue from the history. talk how today, we have applications such as photoshop. we watch videos, save and look at pictures. We play videogames with high quality graphics. if it wasn't for the visual aspect, computers wouldn't be so mainstream. we have a profile picture on our social media accounts, which are all mainly based on pictures and videos. That's why GUI is important

but today not only have gui, but when want to access a server, there is only cli. when dealing with cloud computing. when anything is still new, and you are working with new/"not widely-used" tech, then cli will be the way to go. and programmers are always working with new tech, that's what the best companies do, is explore and expand their business into new tech

# Computer Fundamentals

Watching cat videos on a computer is cool, but what is a computer fundamentally? What makes a given device a "computer"? Because clearly, if our laptops didn't give us access to cat videos, it would still be considered a computer... right?

Well, the word "computer" comes from the verb "to compute", and by adding "er" to the end it means "someone that computes", just like what "writer" is to "write", "dancer" is to "dance", and "programmer" is to "program".

Since the first use of the word in the 1600's, "computers" have evolved. They have gone from a person who computes, to machines that compute. But is computing all that is really required nowadays to be considered a "computer"? For example, take [a "computer" made up of dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6E7aQnA4Ws). Woudl this system technically be a computer? Definitely not (even though in the video, they call it a computer, but they're using the simpler definition of a computer as "something that computes").

Why isn't a ["domino computer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w) or a ["water computer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw) technically a computer? Because in order to be a computer, you have to do more than just perform mathematical computations. That's why a basic calculator isn't a computer.


1. why wasn't the jacquard loom considered a computer? what made the babbage analytical engine be a "computer"?
2. what about a hypothetical device that just takes in sound, and outputs sound. would that be labeled as a computer? why or why not?
3. what are the basic requirements for a device to be considered a computer? what is the bare minimum. what is the simplest computer a person can make?
4. analyze situation of embedded device in fridge. 
5. talk about the computational complexity spectrum, what are the extremes (maybe). talk about software and hardware, talk how can connect external devices using drivers. can get complicated. 
important: make sure to explain what is a computer and what it is not. don't just give boring definitions.

6. mention a sentence or two on: we can simulate a computer using a computer

Domino computer example. 

Now the question is "Can a domino computer become self-aware and destroy humanity?". 


Add some tips,fun facts, notes and questions along the way
> Name a computer around you that usually people don't see as a computer. 

Mention about the modern OS:
Now talk about how to organize everything, drivers, etc. you want a special software that will manage all of those things that we don't need the user to manage. 


The I/O could be anything. But as it turned out
From punch cards, we moved on to keyboards, mice, and monitors as primary I/O devices when personal computers began to be common in the late 20th century. Keyboards and mice provide input, allowing us to tell the computer what to do, while monitors provide output, letting us see what the computer is doing or has done.

# The File System 
Analogy: can have one big notebook, with history math and physics and chemistry notes. However, we all know that it's much easier to sort through things by having a separate notebook for each subject.
Now what if in history class, you have your notebook with your class notes, but one day the teacher asks you to take out a single piece of paper for the weekly quiz. Now you have a notebook, and a single piece of paper. after 8 weeks, you would have 8 single pieces of paper, which should logically be physically together. You don't want history quiz 1 to be between the math and physics notebooks. That'd be a mess when it's time to find the quiz and review it. --> Folder ...
go back to the profile picture example. or the game graphics. behind all of these visuals, is computer code. and code is just text that get's converted to machine code that the computer can understand.  
For the profile picture, that picture is stored somewhere on facebook's server, and when someone visits your account, the page just has a pointer to the location on the server where your picture resides. its a file. everything is stored in files. A typical program executes sequentially, one command at a time. so technically can have one big chunck of code. but that's just like having one large notebook containing all your class notes from all your courses. and computers have way more information than a year's worth of class notes. computers are very complex today, and it's better to organize and store the different funcitonalities into separate files, just like it's better to put different course material in different folders.
