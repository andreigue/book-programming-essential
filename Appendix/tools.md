# Terminal
Have you ever seen a movie where a hacker is frantically typing bright green letters on a black screen? Have you ever wanted to do that? As it turns out, that black screen isn't just a Hollywood invention; it really does exist, and it's called a **terminal**. 

## Importance

Back in the days, knowing how to use a terminal was absolutely necessary to communicate with the computer. Today, almost everyone uses the GUI exclusively. That is everyone except for programmers and IT professionals.

The terminal used to be an entire device on its own (a display with a keyboard), separate from the mainframe computer. Today, we use software called emulators that replicate the functionality of the old-school terminals. So although we technically use "terminal-emulators", we simply call the program a terminal.

-which fields is it mandatory (places where gui is not an option)
-how is it faster, more efficient. give concrete examples

There are several reasons why the terminal is impo

Have you ever wondered how thousands of programmers can collaborate and work on the same codebase, yet still be organized and not overwrite each other's work? This is the perfect time to introduce this tool, because it is typically used within the terminal. It is called **Git**.
