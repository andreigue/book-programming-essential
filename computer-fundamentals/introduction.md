At its core, programming is the act of instructing computers to perform specific tasks. 

A computer, without instructions, is essentially a very expensive paperweight. It's through programming that we harness its immense potential, turning complex algorithms into tangible, useful applications.

Whether it's calculating large sums, displaying graphics, playing music, or connecting with other devices over the internet, all computer operations boil down to intricate sets of instructions we've programmed it to understand and execute.

The languages we use to communicate these instructions come in various forms, known as programming languages. Just like how we use different spoken languages (like English, French, or Mandarin) to communicate with one another, we employ different programming languages (like Python, Java, or C++) to converse with computers. Each language has its strengths and is suited for different kinds of tasks.

The purpose of this book is not to learn about any one specific programming language. Instead, we will learn something much more important: how to think like a programmer. Because if you know how to think like a programmer, you are able to effectively communicate with computers, irrespective of the coding language used.

But why is programming this so vital, and why has it become a central skill in the modern world?

From the smartphones in our pockets to the intricate systems that power our cities, programming plays an instrumental role in shaping the world around us. Think of your day-to-day activities: maybe you ask a voice assistant for the weather, use an app to order food, or play a video game to unwind. Behind all these activities are lines of code, written by programmers.

But what truly sets a programmer apart is not just the ability to write this code but a particular way of thinking. This is what we often refer to as the "mindset" of a programmer. Let's break this down:

Logical: At the heart of every program is logic. A programmer thinks systematically, understanding the sequence of operations and how different components interact with each other.

Creative: While logic forms the foundation, creativity adds the flair. Every problem can have multiple solutions, and it's often the most creative one that stands out, making a program more efficient or user-friendly.

Persistent: Anyone who's ever written code knows that it rarely works perfectly the first time. There are bugs, unexpected outcomes, and challenges. Persistence is about not giving up, troubleshooting, and refining the code until it's just right.

Is this mindset essential for our book? Absolutely. While the technicalities of programming are vital, fostering this mindset will empower readers to tackle any coding challenge they encounter and, more broadly, to approach problems in their daily lives with a similar analytical and creative spirit.

As we journey through this book, we'll not only learn the nuts and bolts of coding but also nurture this mindset, making us not just better programmers, but better problem-solvers.


### Question: Imagine you are organizing a big family picnic and you need to ensure everyone has everything they need (food, drinks, and activities). How would you approach to organize this event?

Possible answer:
1. Approximate the total number of attendees, categorize them as children, teens, adults, seniors.
2. Plan the food and beverage arrangements.
3. Plan the entertainment aspect, including music and activities for kids and adults.
4. Ensure proper seating arrangements (seniors need chairs and tables rather than a picnic cloth on the grass).

Note that some of these, if not all, can be further broken down and made simpler.
