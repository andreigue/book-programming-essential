a tool that allows you to interact with your computer using text-based commands. Whether you're interested in coding, cybersecurity, or robotics, learning how to use the terminal is a valuable skill that will help you in your technology career.

# The Importance of the Terminal

LET READER KNOW THAT TERMINAL IS IMPORTANT. MENTION INTERESTING HISTORICAL EVENT. MORE STORIES FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

EVEN IF WE HAVE GUI, WHY USE CLI. IF USE SOLELY CLI, YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING FOR SURE, MORE EFFICIENT. WITHOUT GUI, NOT GUARANTEED, SOME SYSTEMS MIGHT NOT HAVE GUI OPTION

FOR PROGRAMMING JOB, YOU HAVE TO KNOW TERMINAL

why is it important ESSENTIAL for programmers. its faster, can be used everywhere, repetitive tasks, etc. used everywhere as a default/standard



# What is a terminal

In the last article, we discussed about the historical involvement of the terminal with computers. While the terminal used to be a physical device on its own, with a keyboard and screen which communicates to the mainframe, today we have the terminal in the form of a software, inside our computers.



# Purpose of the Terminal

but today not only have gui, but when want to access a server, there is only cli. when dealing with cloud computing. when anything is still new, and you are working with new/"not widely-used" tech, then cli will be the way to go. and programmers are always working with new tech, that's what the best companies do, is explore and expand their business into new tech


why is it important ESSENTIAL for programmers. its faster, can be used everywhere, repetitive tasks, etc. used everywhere as a default/standard

Some systems dont have gui. expected of technical people to be able to use the CLI
