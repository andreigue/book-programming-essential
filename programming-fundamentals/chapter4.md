In our daily lives, we encounter many repetitive tasks, whether it's setting an alarm each night or brushing our teeth every morning. Similarly, in programming, there's a concept that allows us to handle repetitive actions efficiently: loops. Dive into this chapter to discover how loops work in the world of coding.

## Introducing Loops: The Power of Repetition

## Activities

Now that we've learned about loops let's visualize them!

ðŸŽ¨ Illustration: A flowchart diagram representing a loop that prints "Hello" 8 times. As shown [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.visual-paradigm.com%2Fdiagrams%2Ftemplates%2Fflowchart%2Fflowchart-example-using-loop%2F&psig=AOvVaw3eXjygPKUVObcEHkNF7kqV&ust=1697038491315000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCJDMkZbn64EDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAX)

This flowchart begins with the Start. From there, we set our "counter" to 0. Think of this counter as our track lap marker; it helps us keep track of how many times we've said "Hello."

Next, we have a decision point where we check: "Is the counter equal to 7?" If it's not, we go ahead and print "Hello" and then add 1 to our counter. Think of this as completing one lap and taking a sip of water.

If our counter does reach 7, it means we've already printed "Hello" 8 times (remember, we started counting from 0), and we exit the loop. It's like deciding that you've run enough laps for the day and heading home.

Loops, whether in flowcharts or code, provide a visual and structured way to handle repetitive tasks. With this fun activity, you should now have a clearer picture of how loops operate!

Hope this helps deepen your understanding and makes the concept fun!
