In our daily lives, we encounter many repetitive tasks, whether it's setting an alarm each night or brushing our teeth every morning. Similarly, in programming, there's a concept that allows us to handle repetitive actions efficiently: loops. Dive into this chapter to discover how loops work in the world of coding.

## Introducing Loops: The Power of Repetition

## Activities

**Activity #1:** ...

Now that we've learned about loops let's visualize them!

ðŸŽ¨ Illustration: A flowchart diagram representing a loop that prints "Hello" 8 times. As shown [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.visual-paradigm.com%2Fdiagrams%2Ftemplates%2Fflowchart%2Fflowchart-example-using-loop%2F&psig=AOvVaw3eXjygPKUVObcEHkNF7kqV&ust=1697038491315000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCJDMkZbn64EDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAX)

This flowchart begins with the Start. From there, we set our "counter" to 0. Think of this counter as our track lap marker; it helps us keep track of how many times we've said "Hello."

Next, we have a decision point where we check: "Is the counter equal to 7?" If it's not, we go ahead and print "Hello" and then add 1 to our counter. Think of this as completing one lap and taking a sip of water.

If our counter does reach 7, it means we've already printed "Hello" 8 times (remember, we started counting from 0), and we exit the loop. It's like deciding that you've run enough laps for the day and heading home.

Loops, whether in flowcharts or code, provide a visual and structured way to handle repetitive tasks. With this fun activity, you should now have a clearer picture of how loops operate!

Hope this helps deepen your understanding and makes the concept fun!

**Activity #2:** Imagine you possess another humanoid robot. Resembling an adult human, this robot can flawlessly hear and execute every command you give. However, it's limited to understanding only the most fundamental commands, like "lift your right foot 5 centimeters" or "turn your head 90 degrees left". It's unable to process abstract or compound actions like "walk across the room."

Describe in detail the series of commands you would give to instruct the robot on how to walk forward step by step. Additionally, you can draw the corresponding flowchart diagram.

**Answer:**
To make the robot walk forward, a series of commands can be given, focusing on one step at a time:

1. Lift the right foot 5 centimeters.
2. Move the right foot 30 centimeters forward.
3. Lower the right foot until it touches the ground.
4. Transfer the weight to the right foot.
5. Lift the left foot 5 centimeters.
6. Move the left foot 30 centimeters forward.
7. Lower the left foot until it touches the ground.
8. Transfer the weight to the left foot.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 for continued walking.

This series of commands instructs the robot on the basic mechanics of walking, step by step.
