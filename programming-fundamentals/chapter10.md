### Artificial Intelligence

The term "AI", or "Artificial Intelligence", gets thrown around so much these days that it is impossible to ignore. Companies in all fields are forced to employ AI as a tool if they want to stay competitive and relevant.

But what is AI?

Very simply, AI is about rules and algorithms that help computers perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks could be as simple as following a recipe to bake a cake or as complex as driving a car.

For example, think of a simple AI that plays tic-tac-toe:

```typescript
FUNCTION PlayTicTacToe(board)
    // Check if AI can win in the next move
    REPEAT FOR EACH possible move in board
        IF move "leads to victory"
            MAKE move
            RETURN
        END IF
    END REPEAT

    // Otherwise, block opponent from winning
    REPEAT FOR EACH possible move in board
        IF move "blocks opponent victory"
            MAKE move
            RETURN
        END IF
    END REPEAT

    // Otherwise, take one of the remaining free spaces
    MAKE random move from free spaces
END FUNCTION
```

This little snippet shows how AI uses predefined rules to decide what to do next. It's not actually learning or thinking; it's simply following its programming to try and win the game. And while this is a simple example, real-world AI systems can be incredibly complex, using thousands or millions of rules to do things like translating languages or predicting the weather.
