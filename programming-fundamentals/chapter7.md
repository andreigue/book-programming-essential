Now that we've gone over everything from breaking down problems to using data types, loops, and functions, it's time to put all these pieces together. In this chapter, we're going to combine everything you've learned and build a complete program.

## Arithmetic Operations in Programming

When you think of math, the first things that probably come to mind are the basic arithmetic operations. In programming, these operations are just as essential. Let's dive into each of them:

- **\+** : Addition: `3 + 5 = 8`
- **\-** : Subtraction: `9 - 4 = 5`
- **\*** : Multiplication: `4 * 6 = 24`
- **/** : Division: `12 / 3 = 4`
