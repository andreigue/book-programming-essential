Now that we've gone over everything from breaking down problems to using data types, loops, and functions, it's time to put all these pieces together. In this chapter, we're going to combine everything you've learned and build a complete program.

## Arithmetic Operations in Programming

When you think of math, the first things that probably come to mind are the basic arithmetic operations. In programming, these operations are just as essential. Let's dive into each of them:

- **\+** : Addition: `3 + 5 = 8`
- **\-** : Subtraction: `9 - 4 = 5`
- **\*** : Multiplication: `4 * 6 = 24`
- **/** : Division: `12 / 3 = 4`

## Example Problems

In this section, we're going to tackle a set of example problems that will take us back through everything we've learned so far. We'll start with simpler examples and gradually ramp up the challenge.

### Example 1: Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter

**Question:** Write a function that converts Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit. After creating this function, demonstrate its use by providing a test case.

**Answer:**

To solve this, it's important to understand the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit. To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and then add 32. In mathematical terms, the formula is: **Fahrenheit = (Celsius Ã— 9/5) + 32**.

**Pseudocode:**

```typescript
FUNCTION ConvertToFahrenheit(celsius):
    fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32
    RETURN fahrenheit
```

If we want to test this function, we could call it and pass it an argument, like so:

```typescript
ConvertToFahrenheit(10)
```

On execution, the call `ConvertToFahrenheit(10)` should yield a result of `50` Fahrenheit.
